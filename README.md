# Avrae-West-March-5e-Alias-Pack
These are all Avrae aliases meant for West Marches 5e Discord servers. I cannot release the specific content (as it belongs to other creators) but I can leave the bones of it here for your perusal.

This alias pack was inspired by Kibbles' Tasty's crafting system! I highly recommend subbing to their Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/KibblesTasty

I also bolstered the potion overings in Alchemy, which is the only crafting profession I can release in this alias. You can find their work here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/sp58uf/major_update_to_potion_brewing_and_ingredient/


I have adapted their works and a lot of this was also heavily helped along with the help of the Avrae Dev Server. I literally could not have done this without a bunch of help from them.
